# Sprint 1

Week 19â€“20. Deadline: 16.05.25. Planning:

## Goals

* Review the existing backend from the previous project.
* Set up a containerized development environment using docker.
* Implement a basic frontend.
* Set up a deployment server.
* Set up a CI/CD pipeline.

## Work distribution

* Mats: Will review the backend and identify areas that need improvement / remaking. Will set up a docker compose.
* Sindre: Will make a new CI/CD pipeline and configure the deployment server.
* Mathias: Will work on a basic frontend, either a new one or refactor the old one. Also try implementing /
researching database transactions in the backend.

Once we have identified areas that need improvement in the backend, we can create issues and distribute the backend
work between each team member so that everyone has something to do on the backend.
